# Progress Tracker

*   **Current Status:** Pivoted to **manual** CI/CD setup. Blocked because Terraform files are missing in `coding-crew-agent/deployment/terraform/`. Likely due to incomplete initial `agent-starter-pack create` execution.
*   **What Works:**
    *   Memory Bank structure initialized and updated for manual setup.
    *   `gcloud` CLI is authenticated and project (`gen-lang-client-0926890286`) is set.
    *   Terraform v1.11.3 manually installed to `/usr/local/bin/`.
    *   `gh` CLI is authenticated for user `ivanmolanski`.
*   **What's Next / To Do:**
    1.  **Prerequisites Check:** Enable required GCP APIs (serviceusage, cloudresourcemanager, cloudbuild, secretmanager) in the CICD project (`gen-lang-client-0926890286`).
    2.  **Connect Repository:** User manually connected the GitHub repository (`https://github.com/ivanmolanski/agent-starter-pack`) to Cloud Build. Host connection name is `git-agent-starter-pack`. (Step 2 Done).
    3.  **Configure Terraform:** Updated `coding-crew-agent/deployment/terraform/vars/env.tfvars` with correct values. (Step 3 Done).
    4.  **Deploy Infrastructure:** Ran `terraform init` successfully. First `terraform apply` failed (SA, Buckets, Triggers, Datasets). Imported existing SA, Buckets, and Triggers successfully.
    5.  **Deploy Infrastructure (cont.):** Re-ran `terraform apply`. Failed again with conflicting "Already Exists" errors for Datasets. Attempted to import Datasets, but import failed ("non-existent object"). **Conclusion:** Assume datasets do not exist and proceed with apply.
    6.  **Deploy Infrastructure (cont.):** Re-run `terraform apply` to create missing resources (Datasets, IAM bindings) and update state.
    7.  **Commit & Push:** Pending infrastructure deployment.
    8.  Update this progress file with the outcome.
*   **Known Issues / Blockers:**
    *   Conflicting Terraform errors regarding BigQuery dataset existence (`apply` says exists, `import` says non-existent). Proceeding under assumption they need creation.
    *   Required GCP APIs enabled.
    *   Repository connected to Cloud Build (`git-agent-starter-pack`).
    *   Troubleshooting guide available in `/workspaces/agent-starter-pack/InstructuonsCLine.txt` and `deployment/README.md`.
*   **Decision Log:**
    *   [Timestamp] User clarified manual setup required, correcting previous attempts with automated command/incorrect sequence.
    *   [Timestamp] Switched from automated `setup-cicd` to **manual setup** based on user feedback and documentation. Targeting `coding-crew-agent` project first.
    *   [Timestamp] User corrected missed prerequisite: Terraform needs proper installation. Installed manually.
    *   [Timestamp] Confirmed Project ID `gen-lang-client-0926890286` will be used for Staging, Prod, and CICD environments.
    *   [Timestamp] Confirmed target repository is `https://github.com/ivanmolanski/agent-starter-pack`.
    *   [Timestamp] Updated Memory Bank to reflect added Troubleshooting section in instructions.
